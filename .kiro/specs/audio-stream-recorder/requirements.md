# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Python-based audio stream recording system with web-based configuration and scheduling capabilities. The system will capture audio streams, convert them to MP3 format with metadata, and automatically transfer files to remote locations via SCP. A web interface accessible from the local network will provide comprehensive management of stream configurations and recording schedules using cron-like syntax.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record audio streams and have them automatically processed into MP3 format, so that I can capture and archive audio content in a standardized format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a recording session is triggered THEN the system SHALL capture the audio stream from the specified URL
2. WHEN the captured audio is not in MP3 format THEN the system SHALL convert it to MP3 format
3. WHEN audio processing is complete THEN the system SHALL apply metadata tags including title, artist, album, album artist, and track number to the MP3 file
4. WHEN setting the title THEN the system SHALL automatically generate it in "YYYY-MM-DD Show" format using the recording date
5. WHEN setting the track number THEN the system SHALL calculate it as the number of days since January 1, 2020
6. WHEN metadata includes artwork THEN the system SHALL embed the artwork into the MP3 file
7. IF the stream URL is invalid or unreachable THEN the system SHALL log an error and retry according to configured retry policy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure stream recording settings through a web interface, so that I can easily manage multiple streams without editing configuration files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface from the local network THEN the system SHALL display a configuration dashboard
2. WHEN adding a new stream THEN the user SHALL be able to specify stream URL, metadata (artist, album, album artist), and artwork file
3. WHEN configuring a stream THEN the user SHALL be able to set the output filename pattern and destination directory
4. WHEN saving stream configuration THEN the system SHALL validate the stream URL and metadata fields
5. WHEN viewing existing streams THEN the user SHALL see a list of all configured streams with their current status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to schedule recurring recordings using cron-like syntax, so that I can automate the capture of regular broadcasts or shows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a recording schedule THEN the user SHALL be able to input cron expressions (e.g., "00 01 * * *" for daily at 1am)
2. WHEN configuring a schedule THEN the user SHALL be able to specify the exact start time and recording duration in hours and minutes
3. WHEN a scheduled time is reached THEN the system SHALL automatically start recording the associated stream for the specified duration
4. WHEN the specified recording duration is reached THEN the system SHALL automatically stop recording and begin post-processing
5. WHEN viewing schedules THEN the user SHALL see next execution time, recording duration, and schedule status for each configured recording
6. IF a scheduled recording fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and optionally retry based on configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want completed MP3 files automatically transferred to a remote directory via SCP, so that recordings are stored in my desired location without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an MP3 file is successfully processed THEN the system SHALL transfer it to the configured remote directory via SCP
2. WHEN configuring SCP transfer THEN the user SHALL be able to specify hostname, username, SSH key path, and destination directory
3. WHEN SCP transfer is complete THEN the system SHALL optionally delete the local file based on configuration
4. IF SCP transfer fails THEN the system SHALL retry according to configured retry policy and log the failure
5. WHEN transfer is successful THEN the system SHALL log the successful transfer with timestamp and file details

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system operation occurs THEN the system SHALL log the event with timestamp, operation type, and outcome
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the user SHALL be able to view recent logs and system status
4. WHEN a recording is in progress THEN the system SHALL display real-time status and progress information
5. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL log warnings and optionally pause non-critical operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle various audio stream formats and sources, so that I can record from different types of audio sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to an audio stream THEN the system SHALL support common streaming protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, RTMP, etc.)
2. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL handle multiple input formats (MP3, AAC, FLAC, WAV, etc.)
3. WHEN stream format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL log an error and notify the user via the web interface
4. WHEN stream connection is lost THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect based on configured retry settings
5. WHEN recording duration exceeds configured limits THEN the system SHALL stop recording and process the captured audio

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the entire system to run in a Docker container, so that I can easily deploy and manage the application with consistent dependencies and isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN the entire application SHALL run within a Docker container
2. WHEN building the container THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies for audio processing, web interface, and SCP functionality
3. WHEN running the container THEN the web interface SHALL be accessible from the host network on a configurable port
4. WHEN configuring the container THEN the user SHALL be able to mount volumes for persistent storage of recordings and configuration
5. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL automatically initialize the web interface and scheduler services
6. WHEN updating the system THEN the user SHALL be able to rebuild and redeploy the container without losing configuration or scheduled recordings
