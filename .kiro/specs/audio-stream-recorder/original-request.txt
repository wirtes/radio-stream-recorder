I would like a python tool which is capable of recording audio streams. It should record audio streams, post-process them into MP3 format if they are not already MP3, it should add metadata and then SCP the MP# file to a directory. The configuration and scheduling of the streams should be managed by a web interface that is accessible from the local network. The web configuration interface should allow users to specifcy the stream URL, Metadata for the stream, artwork for the MP3 file, and schedule a recurring day and time to record. Schedules should be input like a cron job "00 01 * * *" for example, for something that should record at 1am daily.
